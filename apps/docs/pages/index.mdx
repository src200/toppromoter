# Welcome to TopPromoter!

It’s great to have you on board. 
In this guide we’re going to cover everything you need to do to get started on the platform and increase affiliate revenue for your product.
Our setup process is low-code, meaning that you only need to add a minimal amount of code to your product to complete the setup process and start gaining revenue via your affiliates. If you’d prefer for your developer to do this for you, you can just send them a link to this page.
